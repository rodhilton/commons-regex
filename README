Commons Regex is a pretty simple library that makes it easier to work with regular expressions in Java.

It still uses the Pattern and Matcher classes from core Java, but provides handy utility methods for common operations.

The library currently has very few utility methods, but I'd happily take requests, suggestions, and (of course) patches.
